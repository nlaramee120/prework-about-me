      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, I am Nick Laramee. I just recently graduated from Millikin University, where I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Athletic Training. After realizing that Athletic Training was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, I decided to make the switch, and I believe this bootcamp is just right for me.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Decatur, Illinois</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Tennis, Pickleball, Bowling, Chess, Juggling, Video Games</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Although not realistic, I've always wanted to be a professional tennis player.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I still live in my hometown, Decatur, Illinois.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always been interested in computers and software, and I wish I would have dove into that interest earlier before I went through college.</p>
